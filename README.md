# Fabric Custom Patterns

This repo stores my custom patterns for Daniel Miessler's framework [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric). For more information, see the [Fabric documentation](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric#readme).

## Adding Patterns to Fabric

This repo assumes that Fabric is storing its patterns in the default location (`~/.config/fabric/patterns`). To make patterns in this repo available to Fabric, simply copy the pattern's folder into Fabric's patterns directory.

## TODO
- Add a sample pattern directory that does not get copied
- Auto-copy patterns to Fabric's patterns directory on commits to main in this repo
